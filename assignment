 We need to download the training and testing data files. It is a .csv type
 
 Now read these two files using read.csv method
 
 Then we are not removing columns that are null. We need to load the caret library
 Find the correlation matrix and create testing and training data. I used train method to
 get the results and called the print method. This will print the maximum possible usages of the users
 how they perform the exercise. In order to do prove these values are correct, we need to use predict using
 random forest method.
 
 load RandomForest libray to find the best predictions.
 
 I used OOB(out-of-bag) to find the prediction on training data and testing data. I got a value is 0.992
